# Cloudless Sky

Code that belongs to the Cloudless Sky fork and not to upstream Bluesky. All
fork features live in this folder. Upstream files change only where a feature
must hook in, and each such file is listed in
[`docs/cloudless-sky.md`](../../../docs/cloudless-sky.md#upstream-files-the-fork-changes).

- `appName.ts`: the product name used in page titles.
- `metrics.ts`: turns off usage metrics unless a metrics host is configured.
- `safeArea.ts`: keeps the web bottom bar clear of the iPhone home indicator.
